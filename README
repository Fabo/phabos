=== Build ===

In order to build the kernel you must define and export the following
variables: ARCH, ARCH_TRIPLE, and LD_CROSS_COMPILE.

If the cross compiler contains a prefix to its name then you must also define
the CROSS_COMPILE variable.


=== Toolchain versioning ===

If you are not using the default version of the toolchain present on your
system then you can export the TOOLCHAIN_VERSION variable. This will allow
you to use another version of the toolchain than the default one.


=== Example ===

Building for the arm architecture:
export ARCH := arm
export ARCH_TRIPLE := arm-none-eabi
export LD_CROSS_COMPILE := $(ARCH_TRIPLE)-
make xxx_defconfig
make
